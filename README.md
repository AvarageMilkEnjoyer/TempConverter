TempConverter by AvarageMilkEnjoyer

Convert temperatures between Kelvin, Farenheit, and Celcius.
Please first enter your starting temperature & in what unit it is.
Then the software will show you what it equals in the other 2 units.
Anti-virus software might flag this, I've tried fixing this by using a base64 encryption method
but this didn't work. It's a false flag.

Read the source code if you don't trust it I guess?

Thanks for using!
